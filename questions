Default values for Site, Area and Target Spit Thickness
Start depth - measure + radio button in single field
Samples/Files in context groups
Delete Matrices entirely?
"Search for context" in featues - So dropdown for adding (with search that updates dropdown). List for loading/displaying is fine, but how would you delete?
Lot ID delimiter - too difficult
Partial search on Lot ID
Field name for radio button in Contexts > General
Context > Relationships list as dropdown?
Load Feature - Doesn't sound bad, but how do you remove a context from a feature?
